Progress notes for my School of Code Bootcamp 13 learning. #100DaysofCode

Day 1: Computational thinking and an introduction to pair programming

Day 2: Computational thinking in practice - applying the concept to word games through pair progamming. Then, consolidation of cloning, pulling, and pushing via github.

Day 3: Variables and functions. We looked at translating Scratch blocks into JavaScript code, and then put together a simple password authentication function in pair programming using 'while' and 'if/else'.

Day 4: Had a mindset seminar about how, when, and why seeking feedback helps growth, both professionally and personally. Discussed the best ways of both receiving and giving feedback. Then moved onto objects and arrays. We looked at what they are, how we do things with them (like select, change, and add items). I also looked into how to remove items using the pop and splice methods. 

Day 5: Hackathon 1. Created a simple rock paper scissors game, using player's name (10 character limit, and used REGEX to ensure it begins with upper case letter) and input (rock, paper, or scissors) to play against randomised moves from the computer player. The game kept a running total of losses, wins, and ties, which it displayed as alerts. Player input was pulled from prompt. 

Day 6: Introduction to codewars. Introduction to the document object model, and how to manipulate it using JS. We ran through a couple of workshops where we changed, added, and removed elements, and properties of elements. For example, appending a number-doubling button to a webpage, allowing users to change the webpage h1 using an HTML form, and selecting and changing style elements. 

Day 7: Introduction to event listeners, and how to use them. We did some pair exercises, and then moved onto changing codee from the rock paper scissors exercises so that instead of taking input from prompts, and displaying results in the console and via alerts, all this was done through interacting with the webpage itself. 

Day 8: Introduction to asynchronous code. We used setInterval, clearInterval, and event listeners to build automatic counters you can stop by interacting with the browser. We built a simple clock, where the minute second and hour hands ticked by with the seconds like an analogue clock. We learned about the call stack and event loop. We created an asynch function to call Kanye West tweets from an API, and display these in a pre-fab browser template as a list.
