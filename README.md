Progress notes for my School of Code Bootcamp 13 learning. #100DaysofCode

Day 1: Computational thinking and an introduction to pair programming

Day 2: Computational thinking in practice - applying the concept to word games through pair progamming. Then, consolidation of cloning, pulling, and pushing via github.

Day 3: Variables and functions. We looked at translating Scratch blocks into JavaScript code, and then put together a simple password authentication function in pair programming using 'while' and 'if/else'.

Day 4: Had a mindset seminar about how, when, and why seeking feedback helps growth, both professionally and personally. Discussed the best ways of both receiving and giving feedback. Then moved onto objects and arrays. We looked at what they are, how we do things with them (like select, change, and add items). I also looked into how to remove items using the pop and splice methods. 

Day 5: Hackathon 1. Created a simple rock paper scissors game, using player's name (10 character limit, and used REGEX to ensure it begins with upper case letter) and input (rock, paper, or scissors) to play against randomised moves from the computer player. The game kept a running total of losses, wins, and ties, which it displayed as alerts. Player input was pulled from prompt. 

Day 6: Introduction to codewars. Introduction to the document object model, and how to manipulate it using JS. We ran through a couple of workshops where we changed, added, and removed elements, and properties of elements. For example, appending a number-doubling button to a webpage, allowing users to change the webpage h1 using an HTML form, and selecting and changing style elements. 

Day 7: Introduction to event listeners, and how to use them. We did some pair exercises, and then moved onto changing codee from the rock paper scissors exercises so that instead of taking input from prompts, and displaying results in the console and via alerts, all this was done through interacting with the webpage itself. 

Day 8: Introduction to asynchronous code. We used setInterval, clearInterval, and event listeners to build automatic counters you can stop by interacting with the browser. We built a simple clock, where the minute second and hour hands ticked by with the seconds like an analogue clock. We learned about the call stack and event loop. We created an asynch function to call Kanye West tweets from an API, and display these in a pre-fab browser template as a list. 

Day 9: We started with a mindset session looking at the importance of cognitive diversity in teams and problem-solving. We looked into what our Myers-Briggs personality types help us bring to a team, and where we might face conflict and challenges. Then we practiced navigating structured data, and extracting information so we could use it - in this case, printing it to the browser and console. Then we spent time researching further topics - in our group, we looked at Chrome dev tools we haven't touched upon yet during the bootcamp. I looked at the uses of recorder, the performance tab, and the subsequent performance insights panel.  

Day 10: Hackathon 2. We used a trivia question API to build a trivia quiz page. It pulled 50 true/false questions, and players cycle through them one by one. Each question must be answered, with navigation buttons to move between them and a score counter to keep track of wins. I polished this up over the weekend, and am in theprocess of adding extra features like CSS and 'help'. 

Day 11: Began the day working independently on coding, then in pairs on codewars. Then had a series of introductions to the agile work method (including importance of MVP and early feedback - the 'shift left'), and UX/UI. We also spent time working on an elevator pitch for our personal career trajectories, reflecting on how our unusual entries to the field work in our favour. We blind-coded a replica of Google's homepage, and wrapped up with an intro to Frontend Master. 

Day 12: Employer/career talk from Javaid and Alex at Nester, looking at the value of a good portfolio and what to expect in our first tech jobs. We then put together a wireframe for our bootcamp application process, and looked into design theory areas like colour theory, balance, user flow, and hierarchy of attention. Then we studied CSS stule specificity, and how the cascade part of the CSS will affect which style is ultimately used when thereâ€™s conflict. 

Day 13: Mindset talk about identifying our listening styles and being attentive to how we work with others. Plus, a look at how developing alter egos can help cultivate traits and habits we aspire to - e.g., confident public speaking. We also heard from Paavan Buddhdev from AND Digital, who walked us through key UI/UX concepts like: don't make the user think, inject wonder into the product, and design it according to what the user expects. We also looked at using > in CSS selections to avoid the overuse of classes, and the value of building responsive design into a page from the beginning. In our research teams, we ran an accessibility audit for Hotwire holiday booking website, looking at its use of space and balance, blocks of text, colour schemes, and how navigable it would be for users with reduced mobility.
